			 				<p class="texts"> First of all, thank you for visiting my portfolio website! I am a college student in Tokyo, Japan. I was born and grew up here in Japan, and the only year I have lived outside this country was last year, when I was blessed with an opportunity to study abroad in the US for a year. I have been studying English since I was 1 year old baby, so I can say that my English is fluent enough to live abroad. I grew up in a same private girls school for 12 years, since primary school to high school. It was such a small community and I wanted to broaden my perspectives and horizons, so I decided to go to a different university, where all courses are taught in English and about 1/3 of the students are internationals. I believe that was one of the best life decisions I have ever made, as it made me realize how narrow my perspectives were, and it gave me a chance to broaden my world. Besides, studying abroad at Carleton College was the best thing that has ever happened to me. That one year was literally life-changing. Wonderful people I met there influenced me so much and changed my world. I'll talk a bit more about this in the education section down below, but it was truly the most meaningful year. And here I am, studying Software Engineering on my own (as there is no available Computer Science course at my university in Japan) and trying make my portfolio that would lead me to get hired as an intern in the US. xx Erika</p>

			 				<p class="texts">Above is my favorite quote regarding education. I probably has forgotten all the things I learned and memorized in primary school to high school, but it has shaped the person I am today. A daily morning service I had at school has shaped the way I think. Teachers and friends I met has influenced me to a great extent. But what is important is to always keep in mind that the community you are in and you are influenced by, is a tiny tiny part of the world that you do not have to what everyone else in your community is doing. Since I went to the same school for twelve years, everyone was doing what other people was doing. If you stand out or try to follow a different path, people around you will spread rumors about you or warn you about all the risks you are taking. I am naturally adventurous and risk-taking person so it was sometimes hard for me. I always wanted to see the bigger world. With this in mind, I studied English like crazy so I can use my English ability to free myself from the teeny-tiny world I was in. When the time had come to think about college, I decided to take a differnet path that most of the people around me was taking, and to broaden my horizon by going to a bigger, better and more diverse university. That ended up as the best and first decision I had made in my life. At my university, it is mandatory to go study abroad for one whole year. <img src="img/IMG_1670.jpg" class="carleton float-right img-responsive" alt="carleton"> I chose Carleton College (picture on the right) becuase it was middle of nowhere in Minnesota and they only accept one exchange student from all over the world. I wanted to go somewhere with less distraction, with closer and smaller community, and no other Japanese exchange students who I would feel confortable being with. I wanted to go out of my comfort zone. All people I met there was new people, with completely different backgrounds but I developed such a great friendships with them. They inspired me greatly, that it chnaged my life. They introduced me to a world of technology and Computer Science. I had never even paid attention to technology before but they influenced me so much that it became my dream to work in tech. </p>
